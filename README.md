# Demo Object Oriented Sinatra

This is a demo app for tinkering along with the Viking Sinatra chapter:
https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/dashboard#/sinatra-web-apps/object-oriented-sinatra

It's not an actual checkers game. For simplicity, it simply adds items to an array.

### To Run
```
# either
$ rackup -p 4567

# or
$ ruby app.rb
```
